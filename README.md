## 🛠 Usage

Here’s how to use the action in your GitHub workflows:

### Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Create Git Tag

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  create-tag:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create Git Tag
        uses: dnogu/actions-create-tag@v1
        with:
          tag_name: "v1.2.3"
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Key Points
- Replace `v1.2.3` with the desired tag name (e.g., `v1.0.0` or any semantic versioning tag you prefer).
- The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions and allows the action to authenticate with the GitHub API.
- Ensure the `tag_name` is unique to prevent conflicts with existing tags.

## 🧪 Testing Locally

You can test this action directly in your repository by creating a temporary workflow file in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

### Example Test Workflow

```yaml
name: Test Create Tag Action

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Test Create Git Tag
        uses: ./
        with:
          tag_name: "v1.2.3"
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Steps to Test:
1. **Set Up the Workflow**:
   - Add the example workflow to your repository under `.github/workflows/test-action.yml`.

2. **Push Changes**:
   - Push the workflow file to your repository on the `main` branch.

3. **Verify the Workflow**:
   - Check the **Actions** tab in your repository to ensure the workflow runs successfully.

4. **Check the Tag**:
   - Navigate to your repository’s **Tags** section (found under the "Code" tab).
   - Confirm that the specified tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) has been created.
